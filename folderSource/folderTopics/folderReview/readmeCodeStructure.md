# CODE STRUCTURE

LET'S STUDY THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF CODE.

## STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS ARE SYNTAX CONSTRUCTS AND COMMANDS THAT PERFORM ACTIONS. WE CAN HAVE AS MANY STATEMENTS IN OUR CODE AS WE WANT. STATEMENTS CAN BE SEPARATED WITH A SEMICOLON. FOR EXAMPLE, HERE WE SPLIT "HELLO WORLD" INTO TWO:

```javascript
console.log("HELLO"); console.log("WORLDS");
```

USUALLY, STATEMENTS ARE WRITTEN ON SEPARATE LINES TO MAKE THE CODE MORE READABLE:

```javascript
console.log("HELLO");
console.log("WORLDS");
```

## SEMICOLONS

A SEMICOLON MAY BE OMITTED IN MOST CASES WHEN A LINE BREAK EXISTS. ON THE CODE BELOW, JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETS THE LINE BREAK AS AN “IMPLICIT” SEMICOLON. THIS IS CALLED AN AUTOMATIC SEMICOLON INSERTION.

```javascript
console.log("HELLO")
console.log("WORLDS")
```

HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME COMPLEX SITUATIONS (WHICH WE WILL NOT ADDRESS NOW) WHERE JAVASCRIPT "FAILS" TO ASSUME A SEMICOLON WHERE IT IS REALLY NEEDED. THEREFORE, **IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO ALWAYS USE SEMICOLUNS**.

## ONE LINE COMMENTS

AS TIME GOES ON, PROGRAMS BECOME MORE AND MORE COMPLEX. IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO ADD COMMENTS WHICH DESCRIBE WHAT THE CODE DOES AND WHY. COMMENTS CAN BE PUT INTO ANY PLACE OF A SCRIPT. THEY DON’T AFFECT ITS EXECUTION BECAUSE THE ENGINE SIMPLY IGNORES THEM.

ONE-LINE COMMENTS START WITH TWO FORWARD SLASH CHARACTERS `//`.

THE REST OF THE LINE IS A COMMENT. IT MAY OCCUPY A FULL LINE OF ITS OWN OR FOLLOW A STATEMENT:

```javascript
// THIS COMMENT OCCUPIES A LINE OF ITS OWN
console.log("HELLO");
console.log("WORLD"); // THIS COMMENT FOLLOWS THE STATEMENT
```

IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE, A CODE CAN BE COMMENTED OUT BY SELECTING THE LINES YOU WANT TO COMMENT AND PRESSING THE "CTRL+;" HOTKEY.

## MULTILINE COMMENTS

MULTILINE COMMENTS START WITH `/*` AND END WITH `*/`. SO IF WE PUT CODE INSIDE `/*` AND `*/`, IT WON’T EXECUTE:

```javascript
/* 
FIRST LINE OF COMMENT.
SECOND LINE OF COMMENT.
*/
alert("HELLO");
alert("WORLD");
```

SOMETIMES IT CAN BE HANDY TO TEMPORARILY DISABLE A PART OF CODE:

```javascript
/* COMMENTING OUT THE CODE
console.log("HELLO");
*/
console.log("WORLD");
```
