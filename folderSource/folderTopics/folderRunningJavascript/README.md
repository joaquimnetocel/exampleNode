# RUNNING JAVASCRIPT

## DESCRIPTION

WE WILL SEE HOW TO RUN JAVASCRIPT CODE IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS:

* USING THE NODE'S _REPL_.
* USING A JAVASCRIPT FILE.
* USING THE BROWSER'S CONSOLE.

## RUNNING JAVASCRIPT WITH THE _REPL_

_REPL_ (READ EVALUATE PRINT LOOP) IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT (BASICALLY A CONSOLE WINDOW) THAT TAKES SINGLE EXPRESSION AS USER INPUT AND RETURNS THE RESULT BACK TO THE CONSOLE AFTER EXECUTION. THE REPL SESSION PROVIDES A CONVENIENT WAY TO QUICKLY TEST SIMPLE JAVASCRIPT CODE. TO RUN NODE'S REPL JUT TYPE `node` ON TERMINAL:

```bash
node
```

A NEW ENVIRONMENT NOW IS RUNNING AND YOU CAN USE IT TO TEST JAVASCRIPT COMMANDS LINE BY LINE. TRY THE FOLLOWING TO CALCULATE A SIMPLE SUM WITH JAVASCRIPT:

```javascript
2+3;
```

TO QUIT THE REPL ENVIRONMENT, JUST PRESS `CTRL+C` TWICE.

## RUNNING A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM TERMINAL

JAVASCRIPT CODE CAN BE WRITTEN IN A FILE WITH `.js` EXTENSION AND YOU CAN RUN IT JUST TYPING ´node´ FOLLOWED BY THE FILE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE:

```bash
node ./folderSource/folderTopics/folderRunningJavascript/exampleRunningJavascript.js
```

## RUNNING WITH THE BROWSER'S CONSOLE

YOU CAN ALSO RUN JAVASCRIPT CODE DIRECTLY FROM YOUR FAVORITE BROWSER.

* OPEN THE BROWSER.
* CLICK WITH THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON ANYWHERE ON THE CURRENT PAGE.
* CHOOSE "Inspect".
* ON THE RIGHT PANEL, CHOOSE "Console" (IF THIS OPTION IS HIDDEN, JUST INCREASE THE RIGHT PANEL WIDTH TO SEE IT).

NOW YOU CAN TRY JAVASCRIPT CODE DIRECTLY IN YOUR BROWSER. AGAIN, LET'S TRY A SIMPLE SUM:

```javascript
2+3;
```
