# _GRAPHQL_ SUBSCRIPTION

## DESCRIPTION

LIKE QUERIES, _SUBSCRIPTIONS_ ENABLE YOU TO FETCH DATA. UNLIKE QUERIES, _SUBSCRIPTIONS_ ARE LONG-LASTING OPERATIONS THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR RESULT OVER TIME. THEY CAN MAINTAIN AN ACIVE CONNECTION TO YOUR _GRAPHQL_ SERVER (MOST COMMONLY VIA WEBSOCKET), ENABLING THE SERVER TO PUSH UPDATES TO THE SUBSCRIPTION'S RESULT.

_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ ARE USEFUL FOR NOTIFYING YOUR CLIENT IN REAL TIMA ABOUT CHANGES TO BACK-END DATA, SUCH AS CREATION OF NEW OBJECT OR UPDATES TO AN IMPORTANT FIELD.
