# _GRAPHQL_ SUBSCRIPTIONS

## DESCRIPTION

EXAMPLE OF [_NODE.JS_](https://nodejs.org) USING:

* _GRAPHQL_ SUBSCRIPTIONS: LIKE QUERIES, _SUBSCRIPTIONS_ ENABLE YOU TO FETCH DATA. UNLIKE QUERIES, _SUBSCRIPTIONS_ ARE LONG-LASTING OPERATIONS THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR RESULT OVER TIME. THEY CAN MAINTAIN AN ACIVE CONNECTION TO YOUR _GRAPHQL_ SERVER (MOST COMMONLY VIA WEBSOCKET), ENABLING THE SERVER TO PUSH UPDATES TO THE SUBSCRIPTION'S RESULT. _SUBSCRIPTIONS_ ARE USEFUL FOR NOTIFYING YOUR CLIENT IN REAL TIMA ABOUT CHANGES TO BACK-END DATA, SUCH AS CREATION OF NEW OBJECT OR UPDATES TO AN IMPORTANT FIELD.
* [_ALTAIR GRAPHQL CLIENT_](https://altair.sirmuel.design/): A GRAPHICAL, INTERACTIVE AND IN-BROWSER _GRAPHQL_ IDE.
