# VARIABLES (LET)

IN JAVASCRIPT, WE CAN STORE DATA IN VARIABLES. VARIABLES ARE DECLARED WITH THE `let` KEYWORD.

```javascript
let stringColor = "GREEN";
console.log(stringColor); // SHOWS "GREEN".
stringColor = "BLUE";
console.log(stringColor); // SHOWS "BLUE".
stringColor = "RED";
console.log(stringColor); // SHOWS "RED".
```

AS WE CAN SEE ON THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, THE `let` KEYWORD IS USED ONLY ONCE, WHEN THE VARIABLE IS CREATED. USING LET, WE CAN CHANGE THE VALUE IT STORES ANYTIME.

## CONSTANTS (CONST)

WE CAN ALSO STORE VALUES ​​THAT WILL NOT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE IN CONSTANTS. CONSTANTS ARE DECLARED WITH THE `const` KEYWORD.

```javascript
const stringColor = "GREEN";
console.log(stringColor); // SHOWS "GREEN".
stringColor = "BLUE"; // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR BECAUSE THE VARIABLE IS CONSTANT AND, THEREFORE, CAN NOT BE CHANGED.
```
