# COMPARISON OPERATORS

## MATH AND JAVASCRIPT COMPARISON

WE KNOW MANY COMPARISON OPERATORS FROM MATHS. IN JAVASCRIPT THEY ARE WRITTEN LIKE THIS:

MEANING | MATH NOTATION | JAVASCRIPT NOTATION
---------|----------|---------
 GREATER THAN | $a>b$ | `a>b`
 LESS THAN | $a<b$ | `a<b`
 GREATER THAN OR EQUALS | $a\ge b$ | `a >= b`
 LESS THAN OR EQUALS | $a\leq b$ | `a <= b`
 EQUALS | $a=b$ | `a == b`

PLEASE NOTE THAT IN JAVASCRIPT THE DOUBLE EQUALITY SIGN `==` MEANS THE EQUALITY TEST, WHILE A SINGLE ONE MEANS AN ASSIGNMENT.

## BOOLEAN IS THE RESULT

ALL COMPARISON OPERATORS RETURN A BOOLEAN VALUE. FOR EXAMPLE:

```javascript
console.log(2 > 1); // SHOWS true
console.log(2 == 1); // SHOWS false
console.log(2 != 1); // SHOWS true
```

A COMPARISON RESULT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO A VARIABLE OR CONSTANT, JUST LIKE ANY VALUE:

```javascript
const booleanResult = 5 > 4;
console.log( booleanResult ); // SHOWS true
```

## COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TYPES

WHEN COMPARING VALUES OF DIFFERENT TYPES, JAVASCRIPT CONVERTS THE VALUES TO NUMBERS. FOR EXAMPLE:

```javascript
console.log( '3' > 2 ); // SHOWS true, BECAUSE STRING "3" BECOMES THE NUMBER 3
console.log( '07' == 7 ); // SHOWS true, BECAUSE STRING "01" BECOMES THE NUMBER 1
```

FOR BOOLEAN VALUES, TRUE BECOMES `1` AND FALSE BECOMES `0`. FOR EXAMPLE:

```javascript
console.log( true == 1 ); // SHOWS true
console.log( false == 0 ); // SHOWS true
```

## STRICT EQUALITY

A REGULAR EQUALITY CHECK `==` HAS A PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IT CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE `0` FROM `false`:

```javascript
console.log( 0 == false ); // SHOWS true
```

THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH AN EMPTY STRING:

```javascript
console.log( '' == false ); // SHOWS true
```

THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE OPERANDS OF DIFFERENT TYPES ARE CONVERTED TO NUMBERS BY THE EQUALITY OPERATOR `==`. AN EMPTY STRING, JUST LIKE FALSE, BECOMES A ZERO.

WHAT TO DO IF WE'D LIKE TO DIFFERENTIATE 0 FROM FALSE? A STRICT EQUALITY OPERATOR `===` CHECKS THE EQUALITY WITHOUT TYPE CONVERSION.

IN OTHER WORDS, IF `a` AND `b` ARE OF DIFFERENT TYPES, THEN `a === b` IMMEDIATELY RETURNS `false` WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT TO CONVERT THEM.

LET'S TRY IT:

```javascript
console.log( 0 === false ); // SHOWS false, BECAUSE THE TYPES ARE DIFFERENT
```

THERE IS ALSO A "STRICT NON-EQUALITY" OPERATOR `!==` ANALOGOUS TO `!=`.
