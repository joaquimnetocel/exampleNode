# BASIC VALUES

A VALUE IN JAVASCRIPT IS ALWAYS OF A CERTAIN TYPE. HERE WE WILL COVER ONLY THE BASIC AND THE MOST USED TYPES.

## NUMBER

A NUMBER IS A VALID DATA TYPE. AS WE CAN SEE ON THE JAVASCRIPT UNDERSTAND NUMBERS AS VALID

```javascript
5
```

## STRING

STRINGS IN JAVASCRIPT MUST BE SURROUNDED BY QUOTES OR BACK-TICKS. DOUBLE AND SIMPLE QUOTES ARE ACCEPTED.

```javascript
"house"
'house'
`house`
house // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
```

## BOOLEANS (LOGICAL TYPE)

THE BOOLEAN TYPE HAS ONLY TWO VALUES: `true` AND `false`. THIS TYPE IS COMMONLY USED TO STORE YES/NO VALUES: TRUE MEANS "YES, CORRECT", AND FALSE MEANS "NO, INCORRECT".

```javascript
true
false
```

JAVASCRIPT IS CASE-SENSITIVE AND ONLY LOWERCASE IS ACCEPTED:

```javascript
TRUE  // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
FALSE // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
True  // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
False // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
```

## NULL

THE SPECIAL `null` VALUE DOES NOT BELONG TO ANY OF THE TYPES DESCRIBED ABOVE. IT FORMS A SEPARATE TYPE OF ITS OWN THAT REPRESENTS “NOTHING”, “EMPTY” OR “VALUE UNKNOWN”.

```javascript
null
```

AGAIN ONLY LOWERCASE IS ACCEPTED:

```javascript
NULL // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
Null // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
```

## UNDEFINED

THE SPECIAL VALUE `undefined` ALSO STANDS APART. IT MAKES A TYPE OF ITS OWN, JUST LIKE NULL. THE MEANING OF `undefined` IS "VALUE IS NOT ASSIGNED".

IF A VARIABLE IS DECLARED, BUT NOT ASSIGNED, THEN ITS VALUE IS UNDEFINED:

```javascript
let color;
console.log(color); // SHOWS "undefined"
```

TECHNICALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPLICITLY USE THE `undefined` VALUE:

```javascript
console.log(undefined); // SHOWS "undefined"
```
