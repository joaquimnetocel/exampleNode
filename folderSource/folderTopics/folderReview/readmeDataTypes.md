# DATA TYPES

A VALUE IN JAVASCRIPT IS ALWAYS OF A CERTAIN TYPE. HERE WE WILL COVER ONLY THE BASIC AND THE MOST USED TYPES.

## NUMBER

A NUMBER IS A VALID DATA TYPE. AS WE CAN SEE ON THE JAVASCRIPT UNDERSTAND NUMBERS AS VALID

```javascript
5
```

## STRING

STRINGS IN JAVASCRIPT MUST BE SURROUNDED BY QUOTES.

```javascript
"house"
'house'
`house`
house // THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR
```
